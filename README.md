1.      Beef stew   is   being cooked   in a   pan that is   (a) uncovered,   (b)   covered with   a   light   lid, and   (c) covered with a heavy   lid.   For which case will   the   cooking   time   be   the      shortest? Why?
2.      Ice can   be   made   by evacuating the air in a   water tank.   Explain   why   this   happens   and how this   process can   be   made   more efficient
3.      CO2   enters a   pipe at 3 MPa and   500   K   at   a   rate   of 2   kg/s.   CO2   is   cooled   at   a
constant pressure as   it flows   in the pipe and the   temperature   of   CO2   drops   to
450K at the exit.   Determine the volume flow rate and density   of the   CO2    using   (a)
ideal gas equation, and   (b) the generalized compressibility chart. Also,   determine
(c) the error involved   in   the first   case.
